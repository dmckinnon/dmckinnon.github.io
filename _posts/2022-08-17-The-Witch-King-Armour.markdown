["I wanted a ... something like a crown of thorns. I don't know if that's suppose to signify anything"]()

I actualyl started making the gauntlets for the Witch King back in 2018, and then put them aside for a while because it was difficult and I didn't like how it was turning out. Came back to it late 2019 while I was doing the mace, and started on that notable helmet:

And then once that was done, got inspiration to finish the gauntlets, and do the cape, other scraps of armour, and polish the whole look off. 

As with the [flail](), there are not many clear shots in the film - except for the helmet - and I did a lot of frame-by-frame watching, and guesswork. Tried to not look at other people's attempts too much, with one exception - I had started from a template of the gauntlets. Can't remember where I got it from - sorry to whoever made it, you deserve the credit.

### Materials
This was not as ad-hoc in terms of materials as other projects, but certainly it was in terms of design. Back in 2018 I had discovered [treeflex](), and thought this would be perfect for armour - and whose armour to start with but The Witch King's! I'm ambitious. 

This stuff is wonderful - comes in thick sheets and its heat-moldable at reasonable temperatures. I would microwave it, use a rolling pin to flatten it out, repeat a few times until it was thin enough, and then draw on the surface with a marker and cut it out with scissors (I cut it fairly thin). Any offcuts can be heated up and rolled back together to make new sheets. Furthermore, anytime a piece goes badly, it can just be squished back together and rerolled and cut. If you cut too small, heat-add some more on. It's amazing stuff. 

At first I didn't have the idea of making it that thin, so parts of the gauntlets are really really thick, which in retrospect probably slowed me down since I was having a hard time cutting and getting it right. Once I thought of making it really thin, that part became easy. 

#### Templates
I kept all my templates, and can attach them at the end as images, with scale in the images. These came from either the gauntlet template I started with and adjusted slightly, or painstakingly watching the relevant scenes, drawing something, cutting, testing, redrawing, and so on. They aren't perfect, if I did some of them again I'd probably tweak a bit, but they're a decent starting point. 

### The helmet
This was a difficult one to start - look at it:

Where do you start? 
After much consideration, I broke it down into:
- a headband from one temple to the other around the back of the head
- a forehead piece that leads into that central spike, that also formed the upper halves of the eyes and had the nose bridge
- each cheek, which would form the lower half of each eye

Each of these I could make separately and then heat-mold together at the end. This actually worked out quite well. 

#### The Forehead Spike
I rolled together two sheets to create a really long sheet as this spike was approximately a foot long (guessing and scaling down to my size). Simple to draw, and just had to make sure it didn't taper too strongly. Here's an initial version that mostly stayed the same:

I used my finger and a butter knife while the treeflex was hot to fold it all around that centre crease, and just pressed it against my nose for the nose bridge. I think the only other changes after that were slightly thinning the spike at the top; otherwise, I hit close to bullseye first go. 

#### The Band
Made a strip an inch or two wide, wrapped it around my head, cut it appropriately, pretty easy. Made sure to make this longer than felt necessary, since the front part of the helmet was supposed to sit out from my face a bunch, so I could cover my face in black cloth to give the illusion of an empty helmet that the film does so well. The spikes were two to three inches, cut from 15mm dowel and belt-sanded into spikes. Hot glue stuck them on nicely. They occasionally fall off, but are easy to stick back on so I haven't bothered with anything stronger. 

#### The Cheeks
The cheeks took a lot of back and forth, especially for minor tweaking, in front of a mirror. One thing I like about treeflex is that you can write on it, so I would make changes, wear it a bit, see how I liked it, compare to the pictures I had, and then write down my notes exactly on the piece itself where the changes needed to be. 

The cheeks are not flat pieces; they curve with the face a bit and have their own waves and so on. Templates only got me so far, but I think I started from a strong spot. Here you can see I've drawn some attempts, molded them back in, and cut new attempts:

### The gauntlets
a logn story



### Shoulders and upper arms
ooft


### The cloak
bought, mostly

### Sabatons
These were a lot of effort for perhaps something not necessary


### A stand
The stand was honestly a rush job: some padding for the bottom spike to take the weight, coouple of sticks to ensure it sat upright, and a holder for the handle. I don't look at the stand much, it's not important.



### Final product
And here's how it turned out!

I'm really pleased with this. A nice glossy sheen from that glue layer, but also has imperfections and cracks that sort of say aging and use has happened to this. If I made it again I think I would have done more experiments with materials at the start, but overall I have no real complaints. The actual mace head itself is hefty, but not unusably so; what adds the weight is the lever-arm force from the handle, since you can't grab the chain at the point. Go back and look at the shot from the film now and consider where The Witch King holds the handle himself ... and then behind the scenes they say an extra lifted it from below. Understandable. 

Let's compare to other versions found online ...

Hey, I got pretty close! Shoulda looked at this earlier for inspiration, but was also very vindicating to know that I got that close by just looking at frames from the films.
