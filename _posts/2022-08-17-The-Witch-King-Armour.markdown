["I wanted a ... something like a crown of thorns. I don't know if that's suppose to signify anything"]()

I actualyl started making the gauntlets for the Witch King back in 2018, and then put them aside for a while because it was difficult and I didn't like how it was turning out. Came back to it late 2019 while I was doing the mace, and started on that notable helmet:

And then once that was done, got inspiration to finish the gauntlets, and do the cape, other scraps of armour, and polish the whole look off. 

As with the [flail](), there are not many clear shots in the film - except for the helmet - and I did a lot of frame-by-frame watching, and guesswork. Tried to not look at other people's attempts too much, with one exception - I had started from a template of the gauntlets. Can't remember where I got it from - sorry to whoever made it, you deserve the credit.

### Materials
This was not as ad-hoc in terms of materials as other projects, but certainly it was in terms of design. Back in 2018 I had discovered [treeflex](), and thought this would be perfect for armour - and whose armour to start with but The Witch King's! I'm ambitious. 

This stuff is wonderful - comes in thick sheets and its heat-moldable at reasonable temperatures. I would microwave it, use a rolling pin to flatten it out, repeat a few times until it was thin enough, and then draw on the surface with a marker and cut it out with scissors (I cut it fairly thin). Any offcuts can be heated up and rolled back together to make new sheets. Furthermore, anytime a piece goes badly, it can just be squished back together and rerolled and cut. If you cut too small, heat-add some more on. It's amazing stuff. 

At first I didn't have the idea of making it that thin, so parts of the gauntlets are really really thick, which in retrospect probably slowed me down since I was having a hard time cutting and getting it right. Once I thought of making it really thin, that part became easy. 

#### Templates
I kept all my templates, and can attach them at the end as images, with scale in the images. These came from either the gauntlet template I started with and adjusted slightly, or painstakingly watching the relevant scenes, drawing something, cutting, testing, redrawing, and so on. They aren't perfect, if I did some of them again I'd probably tweak a bit, but they're a decent starting point. 

### The helmet
This was a difficult one to start - look at it:

Where do you start? 
After much consideration, I broke it down into:
- a headband from one temple to the other around the back of the head
- a forehead piece that leads into that central spike, that also formed the upper halves of the eyes and had the nose bridge
- each cheek, which would form the lower half of each eye

Each of these I could make separately and then heat-mold together at the end. This actually worked out quite well. 

#### The Forehead Spike
I rolled together two sheets to create a really long sheet as this spike was approximately a foot long (guessing and scaling down to my size). Simple to draw, and just had to make sure it didn't taper too strongly. Here's an initial version that mostly stayed the same:

![spiky](/assets/head_spike.jpg){: .center}

I used my finger and a butter knife while the treeflex was hot to fold it all around that centre crease, and just pressed it against my nose for the nose bridge. I think the only other changes after that were slightly thinning the spike at the top; otherwise, I hit close to bullseye first go. 

#### The Band
Made a strip an inch or two wide, wrapped it around my head, cut it appropriately, pretty easy. Made sure to make this longer than felt necessary, since the front part of the helmet was supposed to sit out from my face a bunch, so I could cover my face in black cloth to give the illusion of an empty helmet that the film does so well. The spikes were two to three inches, cut from 15mm dowel and belt-sanded into spikes. Hot glue stuck them on nicely. They occasionally fall off, but are easy to stick back on so I haven't bothered with anything stronger. 

#### The Cheeks
The cheeks took a lot of back and forth, especially for minor tweaking, in front of a mirror. One thing I like about treeflex is that you can write on it, so I would make changes, wear it a bit, see how I liked it, compare to the pictures I had, and then write down my notes exactly on the piece itself where the changes needed to be. 

The cheeks are not flat pieces; they curve with the face a bit and have their own waves and so on. Templates only got me so far, but I think I started from a strong spot. Here you can see I've drawn some attempts, molded them back in, and cut new attempts:

![cheeky](/assets/initial_cheek.jpg){: .center}

This stage had a lot of size adjustment - how long do I make those cheek spikes? How far down and also in front of my face should they go? The recurved spikes back up - how close should they meet in the middle? Many question,and much close watching of various films clips happened. I eventually just picked something that seemed right to me - remember, I'm sizing this to my head - and went with it. Then came the finer detail. Take a look at the cheecks around the ear-level:

There's these deep grooves that lead to a webbed/bat-wing style look. This was just many iterations of heating, molding by hand, cooling, checking, wearing, repeat. For those who want to try this at home, sorry I don't have an exact method for you to follow. Here's an in progress shot:

![groovy](/assets/grooves.jpg){: .center}

As an aside, you can see the history of the piece right there - previous lines and text squished in, previous pieces I used molded back into this cheek piece, and also notes for future changes on the band and the spike. 

All of these pieces attached quite easily together with heat molding - just heat the treeflex join edges up, squish them together, squish it some more so there isn't an obvious seam, and bam done. 

One final note before I move on: take a look at the movie helmet in this scene, particular on the cheek. 

It's as if the metal has eroded over the sheer age of this creature - remember, the Witch King was an ancient being, killed and resurrected yonks before the later Second Age when the hunt for the Ring truly began in earnest. I wanted to try to replicate some of that, and thankfully treeflex makes it quite easy - heat the piece up, and then since it's very grainy within the resin, you can pull the edges and it breaks apart in a similar fashion. Perfect!

### The gauntlets
As I said at the beginning, I had originally found a template online for these and worked from that. I bought some basic black pleather gloves with long wrists online, and looking at the gauntlets from the film, things seemed obvious:

[movie gauntlets]

They're made of little spiky plates lined along the fingers, with some back-of-hand plates that are bigger, with a bit of a webbed bat-wing pattern. This was also clear from the templates:

I did a few iterations of the first spiky plate before settling on a design that was big enough to wrap around my finger, but not prohibitively big. Once I had that, it was just a matter of cutting them all out from a plate of treeflex and gluing them to my fingers.

As I said before, I wish I had thought of flattening the treeflex earlier, if only to make cutting easier. At least I was efficient in other ways:

![groovy](/assets/cutting.jpg){: .center}

This .... just took ages. You know what else takes ages? Watching all the Lord of the Rings films. At least I could do this in the background as I worked. One of the more difficult parts of this was I only had one hand to mold and glue - since the other hand had to be in the glove so things were pressed on in the right way while hot. Yes, I could have bought a fake hand ... alas for hindsight. 

Every so often I would check functionality - could I curl my hand without pieces breaking off, could I grip things, etc, just to make sure I wasn't losing that. 

![groovy](/assets/grip.jpg){: .center}


The knuckles and the back of the hand. Again, there's many ribbed/webbed/whatever plates leading down the back of the hand, and this has proved difficult over the years in that whenever I take it out to wear it I inevitably have to reglue some part of this - the pieces are just not a nice shape to sit on the hand. Ah well. 

[template of back of hand pieces]

Cut from template, mold with two hands, stick to back of one hand, repeat.

### Shoulders and upper arms
ooft

### Painting
I actually had decided on painting back when I started the gauntlets, in that i picked some spray paint colours and gave it go, and followed this theme when I finished each piece incrementally. 

But as with the flail, I felt this was too ... matte, and went with the glue treatment and a slightly different gray, something more worn and metallic. I think Home Depot called it "hammered steel", which felt quite appropriate for armour. 

### The cloak
bought, mostly

### Sabatons
These were a lot of effort for perhaps something not necessary


### A stand
The stand was honestly a rush job: some padding for the bottom spike to take the weight, coouple of sticks to ensure it sat upright, and a holder for the handle. I don't look at the stand much, it's not important.



### Final product
And here's how it turned out!

![More of a staff](/assets/final.jpg){: .center}

I'm really pleased with this. A nice glossy sheen from that glue layer, but also has imperfections and cracks that sort of say aging and use has happened to this. If I made it again I think I would have done more experiments with materials at the start, but overall I have no real complaints. The actual mace head itself is hefty, but not unusably so; what adds the weight is the lever-arm force from the handle, since you can't grab the chain at the point. Go back and look at the shot from the film now and consider where The Witch King holds the handle himself ... and then behind the scenes they say an extra lifted it from below. Understandable. 

Let's compare to other versions found online ... 

![More of a staff](/assets/google.jpg){: .center}

Hey, I got pretty close! Shoulda looked at this earlier for inspiration, but was also very vindicating to know that I got that close by just looking at frames from the films.
