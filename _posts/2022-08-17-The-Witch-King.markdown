### Mock up and materials
A quick comment about materials: this was mostly ad-hoc. My style is to figure out a broad idea at the start, and then sort out smaller details as time and project progresses, so I'm not locked into many tiny cascading decisions from the start. 

First things first, let's get a good look at this thing, and figure out how big I should make it.
