["Some people call it a mace, some people call it a morningstar ... I ended up calling it damned heavy, cos it ... it was damned heavy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAO4t8672hc&ab_channel=Baronessa)

Late 2019 I needed to burn some time and thought it would be fun to start making the flail of the Witch King of Angmar - specifically the version in the Lord of the Rings films:

I had already begun a bit of my Witch King costume, and needed a break, so this provided a related distraction.

[Mock up and materials]()

### Mock up and materials
A quick comment about materials: this was mostly ad-hoc. My style is to figure out a broad idea at the start, and then sort out smaller details as time and project progresses, so I'm not locked into many tiny cascading decisions from the start. 

First things first, let's get a good look at this thing, and figure out how big I should make it. I watched [several]() [clips]() from the film and behind the scenes over and over, frame by frame, to get an idea for the size, using people as a comparison. Eg. Peter Jackson is 5'7", and look at how big the spiky chunk is next to him. That gives a good idea for size. The other part was to make a basic outline shape from cheap foam board. I cut out several cross sections and fit them together to make a 6-point star head at a particular size, before I realised it's 8 points. But this is the sizing draft, so that doesn't matter - and I decided that, in the spirit of Peter Jackson, it was roughly 50% too small. So let's go bigger. 

#### Materials
I didn't know how invested I'd get in this, and so went for the idea of "cheap and whatever I have lying around, plus cheap stuff from Home Depot" - so I used some massive 7-ply boards I had sitting around in the shed. Heavy stuff, but it worked. With my bigger cross sections, I sketched the outlines onto the wood and jigsaw'd these out. These then fit around a centre pole (53mm dowel from Home Depot) that slotted into the centre (photo). At this stage it fit really tight and not well, and was more of a mace on the end of an immense stick. A nice weapon, but not what I wanted. 

Back to the mock up concept, this head felt about the right size, and weight too - I didn't want some lightweight foam thing swaying in the breeze, I wanted you to _feel_ when you were lifting this. This had to feel real. And it did. 

### Filling out the skeleton
I needed to attach these 'ribs' to the central rod, and then fill it out - and probably reduce the weight a bit while I was at it, cos 7-ply was hefty stuff. Well, it had to be sanded down anyway to slot together properly, and also taper the edges. A handheld belt sander did the trick:

And then they slotted togehter nicely, bit of wood glue (a LOT of wood glue) and it held!
So how to flesh it out?

Spray-on space-filling foam seemed the best option, though I weill admit I did not research options extensively. I went through four or five cans to get it to this stage (photo), and then cut it down to something more resembling the final product (photo). Did this with just a kitchen knife, shaping bit by bit until it looked and felt right. There was very little exactness after this, just comparing to photos and eyeballing it. The one difficult part was the spikes - take a look (photo) - they're very ... spiky, sure, but triangular. Or cones with edges. Very particular shape. I was careful to keep the foam like that. Wasn't sure if I was going to do more or not there. 

### The handle and chain
While the head gets built, I need to think about how the handle will attach and how to make it look proper. Here's what it looks like in the film: 

Not super clear, but you can see some outlines of metal "wings" along the handle, it's probably wrapped in leather, and there are some studs. It's also gotta have a chain attach, and be strong enough to hold the weight. I had some spare dowel left over after lopping off ... four feet, so can use that as a base. But that felt a little too thin. Looking around the shed, I had some slightly wider PVC, which fit the dowel nicely. Alright! Got some caps, bolted the ring for the chain attach point through the cap into the dowel, and we have a viable handle! Now it just needs to look right. 

The PVC was easy to cover in pleather, so I just sewed a cylinder of pleather, added the studs, and as a final step after coveringthe pipe I nailed it onto the pipe so it wouldn't slide as I held the handle. Let's take a look at those metal wings then.

You get a vague idea of the shape from the very few closeups we get, which also implies that I don't need to be super exact. This seemed like a good chance to use treeflex - heat-moldable, thin as I need, and nice and rigid once cool. I cut the fins out of thin treeflex for both ends, covered the caps, and just heat-molded the fins on:

Then it was just a matter of painting, and viola! 


The chain was simple, just bought a chain from home depot. Closed up the eyelets with glue or treeflex, and as long as the strain isn't on those exact points, we're good. It's an odd place to have the force anyway. 


### Smoothing
The foam was fairly rough and had little bubbles, so I needed to add something over the top to have a single smooth solid layer. This took a bit of consideration, and I hit upon something when trying spackling. I did several layers of this and it sunk in nicely. Did get crumbly once dried, and this was awkward on the spikes, but I forged on - maybe paint will fix that. 

Well, it got all spackled and there were some cracks, but let's peg that down to artistic license - it's looking pretty good shape-wise! Before I paint, though, need to sort out those spikes. At this stage, they need to a) retain that shape, and b) support the weight. 

### The spikes
I tried putting rigid card over them in the shape I wanted, but every time I leant the flail onto a spike to do another, it bent, no matter how much foam was beneath. I had some [treeflex]() hanging around from attempts at armour, and on a whim decided to make thin covers for the spikes and try that. 
Viola!
These held and didn't bent. Excellent! Added some foam to the base to keep that shape sharp, and now painting can happen. 

### Paint
Just went for a few layers of a nice classic metal gray. Tried this hammered steel to see what effect it would produce:



### Second thoughts, more paint, and then glue
It still didn't look _quite_ right, and furthermore the spackle kept cracking. I was poking around online and saw some suggestions to handle similar issues and also get a nice shine to a final product: a layer of glue. Dries clear, and you're essentially plastic coating. Worth a shot! (did not consider the possibility it might look bad)

Painted that on over the paint, and yeah it turned out really well! Even the treeflex on the handle got the treatment.

### A stand
The stand was honestly a rush job: some padding for the bottom spike to take the weight, coouple of sticks to ensure it sat upright, and a holder for the handle. I don't look at the stand much, it's not important.

### Final product
And here's how it turned out!
