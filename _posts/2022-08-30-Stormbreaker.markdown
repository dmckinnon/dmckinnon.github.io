The pandemic was still going strong in mid-2020, and after the Witch-King's Flail I discovered I quite enjoyed making movie weapons, the bigger the better. The obvious next choice was Stormbreaker, Thor's axe from Avengers: Infinity War.

Despite the ordering of contents below, I made a lot of these parts in parallel until it was all connected. The handle was made at the same time as I worked on the hammer and axe part, and I did a lot of the polishing and finer parts of the hammer and axe simultaneously.

### Materials
Much like the Witch-King's flail, I did not want this to be some lightweight foam thing that could bounce around willy nilly, I wanted it to _feel_ proper, and also be as life-sized as possible. So the obvious materials choices were some sort of metal, with a wooden handle. What sort of metal? Aluminium would be relatively lightweight, but difficult to attach - it's hard to weld, and adding rivet joints everywhere would be difficult and also ruin the look. Steel would be hard to rivet, but easy to weld - and probably give me the weight I want. Some experiments led me to choose 16 gauge steel, as Home Depot sells 12"x12" and 12"x24" sheets of weldable steel in 22 gauge and 16 gauge. I'm not a particularly skilled welder, so I went for a flux-core arc welder, to avoid having the extra gas tanks. Probably should have gone a MiG in retrospect, but oh well. 

#### Sizing
I made a foamboard mock-up to get an idea for size and also the structure I wanted - considering the shape and weight this thing probably needs internal supports and so on. There's a few shots I used for size. The obvious one is above in the introduction, with Hemsworth holding it, but that invovles perspective and makes it not that obvious to discern the size. There are other closer shots, but the best two are this from an interview:

Where we see it right next to his head. Chris is a big bloke, and probably has a big head, but this still involves estimation. The other is from Avengers: Endgame, where Thor cracks a beer open on the blade:

(endgame)

And this is very useful - I know exactly how big a beer bottle is, and this involves little perspective, so I can measure how many beer bottles tall the axe is. Another shot then shows the hammer next to the axe:

(photo)

and from this I can tell the relative size of the hammer to axe, which I know in beer bottles ... bam done. 
Here's the final foam mockup:

And from this I learnt what sort of supports I'd want, what size I was dealing with, etc. Let's get started. 

### The hammer
This seemed the easiest starting point since it's all flat planes and angled joints, no curves. Looking back, I wish I had a plasma cutting table; it would have meant I could CAD-model all this up, export the design, and slice all the pieces. Alas, I did not, so I measured and manually cut each piece with powered metal shears. This worked alright, but certainly was not exact. 

I started with a pair of octagons and welded them together with vertical support pieces. In retrospect these probably didn't need to be as thick or strong, but I was worried this would be too light and didn't want to skimp. From there, the angled sides, to make the back of the hammer. Here's the film:

And compared to mine:

A good start, I think. Next came the longer part of the hammer, and this got trickier cos it has those triangular divets running down the length on two of the sides. Putting aside how exactly I would solve that, I made long pieces just to cover the sides and welded them on with low supports:

And then thin triangles for the corners. My measuring and cutting inaccuracies started to show here, and I had to grind some pieces down or add more weld than I preferred to make up the difference. 



### The axe
Unfortunately by the time I got to this Home Depot was sold out of 12"x24" steel sheets, had no larger size, and the company (Everbilt?) said they were no longer making these. Real shame, cos the way I chose to do the axe blade made this more difficult. Let's look at the axe:



This was fairly long, but also tall. I had th eidea of cutting it down the middle, so each side was two pieces, with a straight edge and a curve. Here's my template:


But this is too big for one 12"x12" sheet of steel, and I had no bigger. What to do? 

I welded two sheets together along one side. This made things a bit wonky, as it didn't weld flat, but ... what else was I to do? Having done that, I could actually fit both the top and the bottom half of an axe side onto one of these sheets, so I cut those out - with an angle grinder, due to the curve, not shears - and welded them together. Now I have the two side of the axe blade. I wanted internal supports so it held the shape, so several rectangles were welded on the inside, and a curve at the line where I wanted teh blade taper to begin.

To get the wedge shape iconic to axes, I first thought of bending the steel with a mold or something since my metal bender vice grip would have been awkward with that curve:

photo

this basically failed. That's not how you bend steel. My next idea was simpler: smack it with a hammer. A lot. 

photo?

This worked. It meant the steel was very dented, and it was more of a curve than a wedge, perhaps more polynomial than I'd prefer, but it worked and the blade edges were close enough together such that I could weld them. I used the slanted bits of wood from the mold to provide flat and heat-distanced surfaces for the clamps, and welded the two halves together. Gettign there!

The final thing the axe blade needed was top and bottom panels to enclose it.

#### Extra detail
But it's not _just_ an axe blade, there's extra detail on top. These patterns:

photo

Difficult to get a clear picture of, but I had a rough idea. A few sketches later and I basically decided upon what I wanted:

#### The base plate

### The handle
The handle was conceptually simple - I got another 53mm dowel from Home Depot, the same as I'd used for the Witch-King's flail handle (link), and this ... was just about the right size I wanted straight away. It also had to be made of wood. Look at the handle from the film:

(photo)

it's made from a bunch of vines and branches twisted together and thickening. Instead of actually weaving all this, I decided to start from a single wooden pole and carve these designs into it to give it that look. I bought a few wood carving tools and got started:

photo

Unfortunately I didn't realise a dremel could do all this a lot quicker, but retrospectively I still like that I did it this way: it's slower and allowed me to plan it more as I went without making a sudden drastic mistake, which is easier with a machine tool. I let the pattern emerge more naturally, as opposed to planning the whole thing ahead; I'd decide on the next few inches at a time, just letting the "branches" twist and flow throughout the design. 

Once this was complete, I did another pass of sanding down splinters and deepening the rifts between branches to solidify the look - some of this I did with a dremel, as well as smoothing, but with a light touch. 




### Attaching it all together
Firstly 

#### Attaching the handle to the head
I welded a couple of supports between the two head pieces, the width of the handle, so that it would sit tight between the two sides, and put a roofing bolt down through one into the top of the handle and welded this down - that handle is not going anywhere. Now all I needed was to add "branches" flowing from the dowel up and around the head. Timber doesn't flow easily, funnily enough, but can be carved. I bought an YxY beam and cut a few blocks off, and carved out the shape of the sides and top of the head from these with a router bit on a dremel:

photo

These were clamped and glued around the head so they weren't going anywhere, and then the real work began: carving the patterns out of this block. Again, they emerged semi-organically, working from the patterns I'd made each side in the handle. There were a few air gaps that I don't like, but it largely went well. Several router bits for the dremel later:

And I had what felt close to accurate! Any gaps were patched with wood putty, which stood out at first but once stained faded into the same colour. 

### The counterweight
Everything being attached threw a particular problem into sharp relief: the head was roughly 13kgs, and the handle was ... 500g at best. Less, maybe. So the centre of mass was basically inside the handle, and this had incredible lever arm force wherever you held the handle. I needed a counterweight to be able to hold it in any way that wasn't direclty upright. But what's super heavy? I need to counteract 13kgs, and shift the balance point to a comfortable holding spot on the handle, perhaps twenty centimetres lower than the head. 

Lead came to mind. I bought a large fishing sinker, 7lbs of lead or so. How to attach this? Well, the melting point of lead is X, and the burning point of wood is Y ... and I'd also felt that the end of the handle needed to look thicker anyway. So I cut another block off the thick beam I had, and drilled and dremeled out the centre to make a) a pit for the sinker to fit in, and b) a hole just wide enough to jam the handle in and attach this tightly. The lead melted easily and was poured into this block, and then I shoved the handle in, screwed and glued it in, and then added branch patterns to this block:

photo

This lowered the centre of mass to almost a comfortable point. Retrospectively, I should have gone easier on the supports in the head. I probably could not have used a much lighter steel, since the welder just sliced straight through the 22 gauge, and 20 gauge and 18 gauge just weren't sold, but I could have used less steel - the supports did not need to be as strong as they were. I didn't want to go much heavier on the counterweight since I still needed to be able to lift this entire thing _at all_.

### Painting

#### The head
This involved a bunch of tests between matte and shiny metal grey:

before I settled on the shiny metallic silver:

I had done a layer of cold gal first, just to make sure it would last. 


#### The handle
The handle was stained, rather than painted; the wood I used was a rather light colour, and I wanted a much deeper brown to match Groot's arm:

photo

So I just did layer after layer of a particular stain:

photo

I think I should have gone darker, but this still looks good and nice and woody. 


### A stand
As with my previous stands (links), this was a quick and dirty low effort stand, as it's not the centre of attention. The only consideration was that the axe had to hang from this, and the stand had to support the weight. I settled for a couple of braced steel beams, with supports between them:

### Final product
And here's how it turned out!

As I've said, the centre of mass is a bit of a problem; less steel should have been used. Also perhaps a darker stain, and more careful measuring. Finally, a computer-aided plasma cutter would have given me much more precise pieces. All those nitpicks aside, this was a lot of fun to make. I really enjoyed the wood and metal work, nothing fiddly with costumes or fitting to my shoulders or head, no foam. 

Let's compare to some other designs I found online - I tried to not bias myself by looking at these too much beforehand or during:

photo

A lot of people seem to do a less branchy handle, or a curved handle. I don't understand why; the film makes it pretty clear. But they do tend to get the head more accurate - I wish I could have achieved more detail there, it is the centrepiece afterall.

### Templates
I don't really have templates for this, aside from half the axe blade:

photo

but I suppose it's easy to make, or at least have photos of a tape measure along various parts:
