["Stormbreaker"](https://youtu.be/HF2sQtH7WpE?t=84)

The pandemic was still going strong in mid-2020, and after the Witch-King's Flail I discovered I quite enjoyed making movie weapons, the bigger the better. The obvious next choice was Stormbreaker, Thor's axe from Avengers: Infinity War.

### Materials
Much like the Witch-King's flail, I did not want this to be some lightweight foam thing that could bounce around willy nilly, I wanted it to _feel_ proper, and also be as life-sized as possible. So the obvious materials choices were some sort of metal, with a wooden handle. What sort of metal? Aluminium would be relatively lightweight, but difficult to attach - it's hard to weld, and adding rivet joints everywhere would be difficult and also ruin the look. Steel would be hard to rivet, but easy to weld - and probably give me the weight I want. Some experiments led me to choose 16 gauge steel, as Home Depot sells 12"x12" and 12"x24" sheets of weldable steel in 22 gauge and 16 gauge. I'm not a particularly skilled welder, so I went for a flux-core arc welder, to avoid having the extra gas tanks. Probably should have gone a MiG in retrospect, but oh well. 

#### Sizing
I made a foamboard mock-up to get an idea for size and also the structure I wanted - considering the shape and weight this thing probably needs internal supports and so on. There's a few shots I used for size. The obvious one is above in the introduction, with Hemsworth holding it, but that invovles perspective and makes it not that obvious to discern the size. There are other closer shots, but the best two are this from an interview:

Where we see it right next to his head. Chris is a big bloke, and probably has a big head, but this still involves estimation. The other is from Avengers: Endgame, where Thor cracks a beer open on the blade:

And this is very useful - I know exactly how big a beer bottle is, and this involves little perspective, so I can measure how many beer bottles tall the axe is. Another shot then shows the hammer next to the axe:

and from this I can tell the relative size of the hammer to axe, which I know in beer bottles ... bam done. 
Here's the final foam mockup:

And from this I learnt what sort of supports I'd want, what size I was dealing with, etc. Let's get started. 

### The hammer
This seemed the easiest starting point since it's all flat planes and angled joints, no curves. Looking back, I wish I had a plasma cutting table; it would have meant I could CAD-model all this up, export the design, and slice all the pieces. Alas, I did not, so I measured and manually cut each piece with powered metal shears. This worked alright, but certainly was not exact. 

I started with a pair of octagons and welded them together with vertical support pieces. In retrospect these probably didn't need to be as thick or strong, but I was worried this would be too light and didn't want to skimp. From there, the angled sides, to make the back of the hammer. Here's the film:

And compared to mine:

A good start, I think. Next came the longer part of the hammer, and this got trickier cos it has those triangular divets running down the length on two of the sides. Putting aside how exactly I would solve that, I made long pieces just to cover the sides and welded them on with low supports:

And then thin triangles for the corners. My measuring and cutting inaccuracies started to show here, and I had to grind some pieces down or add more weld than I preferred to make up the difference. 



### The axe
Unfortunately by the time I got to this Home Depot was sold out of 12"x24" steel sheets, had no larger size, and the company (Everbilt?) said they were no longer making these. Real shame, cos the way I chose to do the axe blade made this more difficult. Let's look at the axe:



This was fairly long, but also tall. I had th eidea of cutting it down the middle, so each side was two pieces, with a straight edge and a curve. Here's my template:


But this is too big for one 12"x12" sheet of steel, and I had no bigger. What to do? 

I welded two sheets together along one side. This made things a bit wonky, as it didn't weld flat, but ... what else was I to do? Having done that, I could actually fit both the top and the bottom half of an axe side onto one of these sheets, so I cut those out - with an angle grinder, due to the curve, not shears - and welded them together. Now I have the two side of the axe blade.
