Despite an extended-yet-half-hearted winter, a lot of hiking, some mountaineering, some cycling and some skiing. I'm only showing the more major events; smaller day hikes do not necessarily warrant a write-up, or some cycling events.

### The National Parks of Utah
This was a 9-day trip designed by a friend where we basically did all the biggest and best things the Big 5 in Utah had to offer: Arches, Canoynlands, Capitol Reef, Zion, and Bryce. 

Well, that's not quite true - we didn't do _most_ of Canyonlands since it is just too big, and I didn't get to do The Narrows in Zion due to flooding at the time (also cyanobacteria concerns just put me off it in general). We also missed a canyon track that you had to pre-book in Arches. Regardless, I feel we got immense coverage of the parks - even on our designated rest day we ended up walking 17km.

#### Arches
We planned to get there as early as possible as it was a sunday and we were pretty sure it will fill up very quickly. We weren't wrong - after the first parking spot, it was difficult to find anywhere else. Alas that Arches is so big. Here's a map of Arches:

We started by doing the Arches loop, covering (list of arhces). Some were duds, but some looked great:

Then nearby was the track for Broken Arch, Skyline Arch, and Sand Dune arch (check). Next on the list was the big one: Delicate Arch. This was a short walk from the parking lot but was very well-travelled, due to its number plate fame, and it certainly delivered:

It's _huge_, way bigger than I thought, and also thankfully was not as packed as we were expected. Moving on, we hit up Double Arch (not to be confused with Double O Arch), Turret Arch, South and North Arches, and Balancing Rock,

before walking down a canyon to The Organ, which didn't feel rightly named; it was just a tall mesa. Then again, Broken Arch wasn't broken, so clearly their whole naming system was off-kilter.

### Colorado
Colorado, as I only learnt in recent years, has loads and loads of "14ers" - mountains with over 14 000 feet of elevation (and over 300 feet of prominence?) - which is about 4260 metres. This is definitely enough to get altitude sickness to kick in; indeed, I'd had this before when summitting Mt Rainier (4392m), Mauna Kea (4207m - technically a 13er not a 14er), and Mt Adams (3700m). So it was with apprehension that I went to Colorado with [Joe](www.josephdegol.com) to bag Blanca Peak, Ellingwood Peak, Kit Carson, Challenger peak, and as a stretch goal, Crestone, all above 4260 metres. 

#### Blanca and Ellingwood
Since I flew into Colorado Saturday afternoon, the plan was to camp the night at the trailhead (~2300m ish), hike up to Lake Como (~3500m ish), stay the night at elevation to acclimate (specifically for me, Joe is a mountain goat), and then summit the next day, bagging both peaks in one hit (it was a short traverse from one to the other) then descend before noon as thunderstorms were expected in the afternoon. 

The trailhead is fuzzy, since there is a sign but you can keep driving - all the way up to Lake Como, if your car can handle The Jaws (I, II, and III). It's an offroad-vehicle track, that started as bumpy dirt and soon got incredibly rocky. We pulled over late at night as some random guy on the side hailed us, calling out "hey you guys wanna see Jupiter?"
After deciding that seeing Jupiter was worth the risk of a random Colorado desert man killing us, we pulled over and sure enough, he had his telecope aimed at Jupiter. The skies there were incredibly clear, you could see the entire Milky Way - alas that my phone camera quality was not enough, even looking through his telescope. I saw the Galilean moons, and the bands on Jupiter - not the Red spot though. Next came Saturn, which while much fainter was almost better since we saw the iconic rings. We also even managed to see the Andromeda Galaxy, with naked eye, binoculars, and telescoped. A faint smudge, but still cool. 

The next morning, after Lou departed, we drove as far up the road as we dared, bumping and jostling around in the car, then parked and set off. There was the occasional car parked off to the side, these getting more and more rugged, until we hit The Jaws:

These were so steep and bouldery I almost did not believe that they could be driven - but further up at Como Lake and and beyond, we saw people driving offroaders, so surely they must have tackled the Jaws? I youtube'd it when back in civilisation, and sure enough it's quite popular. Much easier and safer on foot though. We set up camp at Como at around noon:

and then thought "it's a really good day, clear forecast for the rest of the afternoon, and it'd be nice to not rush tomorrow ... should we just climb today?" So we dropped all spare weight, and headed off up the offroad trail, seeing a few cars even further up. It started to get very rocky as we approached the saddle, and basically turned into a class 3 scramble from then on up:

Blanca was first on the list, and easiest, so we went right. It actually wasn't that much higher than the saddle, but the scramble slowed us. Finally, the summit! We could see Ellingwood, Little Bear, Lindsey, even over to Crestone and Humbolt. I find it amazing that instead of Washington's general hilliness leading into mountains that Colorado just has enormous flat plains, and then very suddenly - up. A lot of up. We had climbed about 1850 metres from the trailhead, and my head was pounding with altitude sickness, but it was an incredible view.

It was starting to get late though and combined with my head being the way it was we called it and heading down off blanca, skipping Ellingwood. Sad, but better than attempting it and getting stuck with a worse headache. At least this meant a relaxing morning the next day before the hike out. and we could see the potential thunderstorms closing in as we drove away:
