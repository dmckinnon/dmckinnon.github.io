![First attempt](/assets/cannon/samus_gun_circled.png){: .center}

After making Samus' arm cannon - along with a Nerf gun inside of it - I thought "it seems a bit silly to have such a good arm piece, but not the rest of the costume". I'd found Samus' helmet on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1461378) in [various](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4640583) [models](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1214085/files), along with the [shoulder pieces](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1214085/files). The rest of the suit looks more body-molded than the shoulders and helmet; I could 3d print this, but getting size and shape right would take a lot of iterations, and these would also be big pieces. Regardless, I definitely thought I could give it a decent enough bash so that I had a full suit - much better than just the arm cannon.

### Materials
Since I had 3d models of the helmet and shoulders, these were going to be 3d printed, and I used PLA. Simple, cheap, effective. 

So what to make the rest of the suit from? Printing it sounded like it could be good, and I saw some designs online where people printed the whole thing. But many hardshell pieces of a costume can be a pain, and really reduce maneouverability, so after buying some EVA foam and testing it, I decided to make each piece from EVA foam: it can be heat-molded to a shape (within reason), it was easy to cut, and it came in large sheets. There's also a plethora of tutorials online, and of course I ignored most of this, opting for trial and error. Most of the pieces were hot glued together, which was quick and easy but was one-way - however most glues probably were. It made pieces difficult to cut through, in a way other glues might not have, so if I did this again I think I would forgo this decision. 

The undersuit was a latex onesie meant for diving or something, that I actually bought years ago to make a Tron costume from. I experimented with several different ways of attaching the foam panels before deciding on velcro - it could be applied en masse and give a greater surface area than singular pop tabs, and was easy to machine-sew on.

### The Helmet and Shoulders
You might think that this was straightforward and I just printed these pieces, painted, done.

No. 

There were sizing issues, printing issues, printer failures, nozzle tests, and various other problems. 

#### The Helmet
As linked above, there are several helmet models I found. I started with this [well-labelled one](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4640583) from Thingiverse before realising that the size it was printing at was _far_ bigger than practical. Alright, time for a resize. I 3d-scanned my head and reconstructed the model around my head, resizing it to fit. But wait! I need to make sure tmy head fits through the bottom. Do I print half this and test? 
Then I came across this [Frankly Built tutorial]() where he makes a Metroid Dread helmet, using a [purchased model]() from do3d.com - and more importantly, he didn't resize, he just printed it and it just about worked. His head looks normal sized, so I bought this model for $30 and decided to give it a go. 

picture?

Without changing the size, it was too big for my printer. But thankfully, it came not just in a single model, but also in 6 pieces - the original model sliced down the middle of the face and twice sideways through the head. Each of these pieces fitted easily on my printer. But I needed a way to reattach them after printing them, so i added tabs across each of the cuts with a screw either side:

so I could screw it all back together at the end. This had some error, but it's been negligible and I've gotten used to the look:

Next, the visor. Frankly Built used clear plastic with a sheet of green translucent plastic from car headlight tints; these cost a fair bit, but I found some coloured lighting tints for hobbyist filmmaking, and among these was a good shade of green:

Finally, the mask. Note in this picture Samus appears to have some sort of oxygen mask covering her mouth and nose

Frankly Built achieved a similar thing with a basic gas mask from Home Depot, so I bought a similar one, tore off the air filters, and glued it in: perfect!

I'll go over the painting later. 


#### The Shoulders
[The shoulders also came from Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1214085/files), although I had to do some size checking. I printed some test slices to gauge size, and a full version to see how it looked. This first one ended up about 95% of the size that felt good, but also far too dense - I needed to really tone the settings down for this, since it weighed about a kilogram alone. 1kg per shoulder was not going to feel good. 

The next problem was how to attach this to my shoulder. The shoulder spans about 90 degrees, which doesn't attach to a shoulder well. I need something to hold it inwards, and upwards. I designed a ring to attach on the inside:

photo

This held it up, from the upper part of the circle. But how to stop it from slipping down my arm held by my side? Well, I added slits for straps:

photo

and with one on each shoulder, cinched tightly, these would hold each other in. Certainly with my mega-heavy shoulder this wasn't pleasant, but after reducing shell thickness infil density I got one shoulder to 700 grams and the other to 500 grams. My printer also broke through this, and I had _a lot_ of failures.

Then sanding and painting, which comes later.

#### The jetpack
Take a look at Samus' back:

photo

That's a jetpack. Or at least I'm calling that a jetpack. I found a full model of Samus from Metroid Dread, which has a slightly different jetpack to Metroid Prime, but it was complete. I cut away the rest of the model to just have the jetpack pieces:

photo

and thankfully these were separated out so I could print them separately. They came out a little thicker than I preferred, due to some messiness converting from a infinitely thin mesh to a full 3d body with thickness, but it worked out. These pieces are just hot-glued together, and then glued down to a sheet of foam:

photo


### Forming the foam
Let's look at Samus' armour again:

photo

There's black lines throughout the armour, which I'm going to use to break up the armour into distinct pieces, eg. a shin piece, a thigh piece, many chest pieces, etc. Given that this is all attached to a black onesie, the black background is taken care of; I just need each brightly coloured piece. The green will be LEDs, and the rest just formed from EVA foam. 

#### The shins
Shins seemed the easiest starting point because I can reach my shin with both arms - this serves to help form the heated foam around my shin, and also meant I could prototype quickly with sewing various attachment methods. To get the shape I just ... looked at a few images of Samus

photo


and then held foam around my leg in various ways, and drew and cut repeatedly until I had the basic outline. A little refinement later, and I had what ended up being close to the final version:

photo

This was two layers - one to hold the shape, the other to add depth so that the LEDS could be inset into the foam. I had 4mm foam, so attempting to inset the LEDs into one sheet would ahve been a nightmare. 
Once I had the shape sketched and cut out, I started prototyping attachments by attaching the foam with metal pops:

photo

but as these were just points of connection, at the back of my shin where the tension was greatest (since that's where the foam shape deviated from body shape the most) the foam pulled away at those points. I switched to velcro, where there's far more surface area, and this held close to my leg a lot better. I also redid the shin piece. The first time, I glued two layers of foam together, cut out a section for the LEDs, and _then_ heat-molded it. This was bad, for one main reason: the two sheets are already glued. They have a relative position to each other. The heat-molding tries to change this, but the glue resists. For the second attempt, I cut two pieces, heat-formed them around my leg, _and then_ glued them together. This held the right shape a lot stronger. 
The knee piece was made from two halves, glued together to get that curved shape, and then glued bending forwards on the top of the shin piece. 
Finally, although I now think this was a mistake, I had slit the outer sheet of foam on the shin to reduce the strain and let that black line down the front of the shin be visible:

photo

but then I decided I didn't like this, and covered it up with EVA foam putty. This looked kinda awkward, but I didn't want to redo the whole shin. 

#### The thighs
The thighs were next, because my mind was still on the legs and they were still easier to work with than, say, one arm, where by nature of the location I had to do it single-handedly (pun intended). Let's look at the thigh pieces:

photo

There's an underlayer of yellow, and that orange piece on top of it that sits on the outer thigh, with the green light embedded in. This looks similar to the shin pieces, LED-wise, so I copied that strategy of putting a second layer over the first. I shaped both to my leg, and then glued them together. This took ... just a lot of hours of iterating and pinning pieces together, reheating, trying again, and so on. Thighs are an utter pain to shape to. Finally, I got something resembling the shape I wanted:

photo

Now to do that for the other leg, and we are good. 

#### The abdomen
Moving up the body, we have the lower torso. This consists of what amounts to a large foam nappy, and what I implemented as several wraparound-the-waist pieces with some smaller squares at the front. Here's what's on Samus:

photo

And here's what I made:

photo

This was pretty simple, not much to talk about. I did a couple of iterations per base shape, and then repeated the strips up the chest. 

#### The arms
Not much to say here either. These pieces just need to wrap around both upper arms, and my left forearm. I made two pieces for the upper arm to get a natural black line; I semi-regret that now as one single wraparound piece is functionally easier. Ah well. 

#### The chest
The final of the foam pieces, the chest. Take a look:

photo




#### The back
This is covered above in The Jetpack section. I just lay down on a piece of foam while a friend traced my outline, and then held this against my back and cut it down and heat-moulded it. Then I glued the 3d printed jetpack to it.

### Paint
Given that this was 3D printed, I had to sand the surface smooth before painting, otherwise you get these print artefacts where you can see the layer lines. First a 60 grit pass, then 120 grit, then 240 grit to polish it 

### Final product
And here's how it turned out!
